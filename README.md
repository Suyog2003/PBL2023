# PBL2023
To collaborate and contribute for PBL Project TBD

Meet me at midnight
Starin' at the ceilin' with you
Oh, you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into
My melancholia
I've been under scrutiny (yeah, oh, yeah)
You handle it beautifully (yeah, oh, yeah)
All this shit is new to me (yeah, oh, yeah)
